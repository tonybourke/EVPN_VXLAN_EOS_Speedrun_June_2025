In the video below, I did a speedrun building an EVPN/VXLAN fabric on Arista EOS.

The system you see me working on is called the Autobox: https://github.com/tonybourke/Project-NERD/tree/main/Autobox

It's just a set of instructions that build a Linux VM, installs code-server (VS Code running as a webapp), Ansible, containerlab, and a few other things. 

The topology is the medium topology from my topologies here: https://github.com/tonybourke/NERD_clab_topologies
